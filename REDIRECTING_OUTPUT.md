# Redirecting Output

## My Solve:
The challenge required redirecting the string PWN to a file named COLLEGE using the output redirection operator (>). 
did this and got the flag.

*Flag:* pwn.college{gDQrw-sjZUT5ciBjHiR63RymJ_o.QX0YTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

hacker@piping\~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE            
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your              
flag:                  
pwn.college{gDQrw-sjZUT5ciBjHiR63RymJ_o.QX0YTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}           
hacker@piping\~redirecting-output:~$
