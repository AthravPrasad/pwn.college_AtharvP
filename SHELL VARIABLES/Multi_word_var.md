# Multi-Word Variables

## My Solve:
I set the variable PWN to the multi-word value COLLEGE YEAH. 
I enclosed the value in double quotes (") to ensure the shell treated the entire string, including the space, as a single value for the variable.

*Flag:* pwn.college{kzaWi30jR5F_Kk19zScDyve9v2T.QXwYTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

'''hacker@variables\~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"               
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:         
pwn.college{kzaWi30jR5F_Kk19zScDyve9v2T.QXwYTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}'''
