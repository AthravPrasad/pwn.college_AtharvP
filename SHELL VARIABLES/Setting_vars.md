# Setting Variables

## My Solve:
I set the environment variable PWN to the value COLLEGE by simply typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign, and then the value (PWN=COLLEGE).

*Flag:* pwn.college{IP38ph5TKDtwKXcta1iI9V_Hkx4.QX5UTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

hacker@variables\~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE                       
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:        
pwn.college{IP38ph5TKDtwKXcta1iI9V_Hkx4.QX5UTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}       
hacker@variables\~setting-variables:~$
