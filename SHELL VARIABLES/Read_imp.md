# Reading Input

## My Solve:
I used the read command to set the variable PWN to the value COLLEGE. I included the -p option to display the prompt INPUT:  before receiving the input.
After entering COLLEGE, the variable was set correctly, yielding the flag.

*Flag:* pwn.college{olp2R3a92IjaMUvTnqX6_6N8qY-.QX4cTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

hacker@variables\~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN        
INPUT: COLLEGE         
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:         
pwn.college{olp2R3a92IjaMUvTnqX6_6N8qY-.QX4cTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}
