# Tab Completion on Commands

## My Solve:
The challenge required executing a program with a long, unique name.
I typed the first few letters of the program name (pwn) and then pressed the Tab key.
The shell automatically completed the command to pwncollege-18475, which I then executed to retrieve the flag.

*Flag:* pwn.college{QxK9LcUmJIEbl6EZ8HFOROBeEPZ.0VN0EzNxwCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

hacker@globbing\~tab-completion-on-commands:\~$ pwncollege-18475

pwn.college{QxK9LcUmJIEbl6EZ8HFOROBeEPZ.0VN0EzNxwCOwMzNzEzW}
