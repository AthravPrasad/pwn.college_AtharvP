# Programs_and_Absoute_Paths.md

## My Solve:
The Flag was in the run directory which in turn was in the challenge directory which was in root, so we directly invoked it by specifying its absolute path.

## Flag:
pwn.college{YJehScBLYk_v2_mRpgopalXgsUi.QX1QTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}

bash \
hacker@paths\~program-and-absolute-paths:\~$ /challenge/run \
Correct!!! \
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag: \
pwn.college{YJehScBLYk_v2_mRpgopalXgsUi.QX1QTN0wCOwMzNzEzW}
