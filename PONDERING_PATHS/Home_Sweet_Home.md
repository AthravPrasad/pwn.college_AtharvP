# Home Sweet Home

## My Solve
This was the best of all challenges done as it was difficult to comprehend what to do.
So first accordingly, I made the file in which i want my flag to be stored.
After that invoked that file to the specified folder and got the flag

*Flag*: pwn.college{8ClGMeCWfZpaB_sVN579R05j4DT.QXzMDO0wCOwMzNzEzW} 

bash \
hacker@paths\~home-sweet-home:\~$ touch x    
hacker@paths\~home-sweet-home:\~$ /challenge/run ~/x     
Writing the file to /home/hacker/x!     
... and reading it back to you:     
pwn.college{8ClGMeCWfZpaB_sVN579R05j4DT.QXzMDO0wCOwMzNzEzW}     

## Notes and Errors:
Often wrote /~ instead of ~.

## References
