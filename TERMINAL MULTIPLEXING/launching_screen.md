# Launching Screen


## My Solve:
The objective was simply to successfully launch a screen session to receive the flag. This challenge is designed to introduce the basic functionality of terminal multiplexers.
I executed the screen command.
The program detected the new session, executed a routine to print the flag, and the flag appeared immediately in the terminal session.

*Flag:* pwn.college{th4tsdfw45qw4llqwt0ffg345yqw45ntbn1t.0v3tMDOxwCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

'''hacker@terminal-multiplexing\~launching-screen:~$ screen                  
\[screen session is launched]                 
pwn.college{th4tsdfw45qw4llqwt0ffg345yqw45ntbn1t.0v3tMDOxwCOwMzNzEzW}hacker@terminal-multiplexing\~launching-screen:\~$
