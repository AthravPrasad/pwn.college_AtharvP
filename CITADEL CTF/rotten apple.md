# My solve...
The description indicates a 'rot' cipher, specifically mentioning numbers 47 and 13. 
This strongly suggests using ROT-47 and ROT-13 decryption methods sequentially.
First, apply ROT-13 to the ciphertext, resulting in an intermediate string.
Next, apply ROT-47 to that intermediate string to reveal the final flag. flag
