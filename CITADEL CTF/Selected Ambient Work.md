Analysis of the WAV file revealed that Morse code begins playing a few seconds into the music and continues for the remainder of the audio track.
Standard online decryption tools struggle due to audio distortion.
Visual inspection of the audio's spectrogram in software like Audacity or Sonic Visualiser provided the necessary clarity.
The flag format, specifically citadel{, is observable at the 1:00 mark, and the closing } is visible at 1:12.
This confirms that the crucial Morse code sequence is located between these two timestamps.
The clear spectrogram visualization of the Morse code within the specified twelve-second window is: .----   .-.. ----- ...- ...--   .---- -.. --.
This sequence decodes to the plaintext: 1 L0V3 1DM.
The core information needed for the challenge is the specific code found between the marked time points. 

*Flag:*Â citadel{1_L0V3_1DM}
