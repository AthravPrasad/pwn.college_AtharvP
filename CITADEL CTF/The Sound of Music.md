The description directs the user to online music profile sites associated with the username citadweller, specifically mentioning last.fm, rateyourmusic, and albumoftheyear.
The first flag segment, citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n, was located within the shoutbox section of the last.fm/user/citadweller profile.
The second, middle segment, _n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es, was consistently present in the profiles on both the rateyourmusic and albumoftheyear platforms.
Furthermore, the bios on these two sites contained a tinyurl link redirecting to the Spotify profile also named citadweller.
The final portion of the flag, _n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}, was successfully retrieved from the description of a public Spotify playlist created by this user.
Concatenating the three parts yields the complete flag.
