# My solve
The problem is identified as the Collatz Conjecture.
The task requires the creation of a function to efficiently calculate the number of Collatz steps for each numerical input received from the server instance.
By utilizing the provided PDF for the mathematical definition and the helper.md file for communication guidance, the user can construct a solve script.
This script will be configured to establish an interactive connection with the remote instance using either the socket library or the pwntools framework.
The script's core functionality will involve reading the number, computing the required Collatz steps, and sending the correct result back to the server to eventually retrieve the final flag.
