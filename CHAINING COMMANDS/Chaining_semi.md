# Command Chaining with Semicolons

## My Solve:
I successfully executed the two required commands, /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college, sequentially.
To ensure that both commands ran, regardless of the exit status of the first, I chained them using a semicolon (;).

*Flag:* pwn.college{gqb19UHdQMuxNWNnV0CysSELulf.QX1UDO0wCOwMzNzEzW}

Bash

'''hacker@chaining\~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college             
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:              
pwn.college{gqb19UHdQMuxNWNnV0CysSELulf.QX1UDO0wCOwMzNzEzW}'''
