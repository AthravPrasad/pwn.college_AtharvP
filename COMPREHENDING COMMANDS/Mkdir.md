# Making Directories 

## My solve:
Firstly make a directory by using mkdir command and following the specified path.
Furthermore, make a file using touch command .
For flag, run /challenge/run

*Flag:* pwn.college{Qiu6-TCoVOR3UmcKZqtATn9wC

bash \

hacker@commands\~making-directories:\~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn.  
hacker@commands~making-directories:
~$ cd /tmp/pwn     
hacker@commands~making-directories:
/tmp/pwn$ touch college   
hacker@commands~making-directories:
/tmp/pwn$ /challenge /run    
bash: /challenge: Is a directory.   
hacker@commands~making-directories:
/tmp/pwn$ cd /
hacker@commands~making-directories:
/$ /challenge/run    
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Qiu6-TCoVOR3UmcKZqtATn9wC
