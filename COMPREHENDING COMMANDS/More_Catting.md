# Using More Cat 

## My solve 
Write cat followed by file path.

*Flag:* pwn.college{gebP-pPKNrZUBa_wVDu5H9buK5B.QXwITO0wCOwMzNzEzW}

bash \
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by     
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it     
in the file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/flag. Go cat it out **without**     
cding into that directory!       
hacker@commands\~more-catting-practice:\~$ cat /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/flag     
pwn.college{gebP-pPKNrZUBa_wVDu5H9buK5B.QXwITO0wCOwMzNzEzW}
